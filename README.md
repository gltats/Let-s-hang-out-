# Let-s-hang-out-
This is a simple website that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


## Technical details: 
HTML:  
- The HTML code is written using the latest HTML5 standards and includes semantic tags for better accessibility and SEO.  
- The "meta" tags are included to provide information about the character set, browser compatibility, and viewport settings.  
- The "link" tag is used to link the CSS stylesheet to the HTML document.  
- The "script" tag is used to link the JavaScript file to the HTML document.  

CSS:  
- The CSS stylesheet is linked to the HTML document using the "link" tag in the head section of the HTML file.  
- The stylesheet contains rules for styling the HTML elements, such as the page layout, font styles, and colors.  
- The ".footer" and ".underline-with-movement" classes are used to style the footer and hyperlink elements respectively.  
- The ".wrap" and ".svg" classes are used to create the animated snowball graphics.  

JavaScript:  
- The JavaScript file is linked to the HTML document using the "script" tag in the head section of the HTML file.  
- The JavaScript code handles the button clicks and generates the appropriate response.  
- The "yes()" function is called when the "Yes" button is clicked, and it generates a pop-up message.  
- The "history.go(0)" function is called when the "No" button is clicked, and it reloads the page.  
- The jQuery library is used to simplify the JavaScript code and make it more efficient.  

General:  
- The website uses an animated GIF of a snowball bunny carrot for visual appeal.
- The website is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes using the viewport settings in the HTML "meta" tag.

## Other
- Note that the "no" button is intentionally disabled.
